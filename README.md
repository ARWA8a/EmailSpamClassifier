The goal of this machine learning project is to develop a system for detecting and classifying emails to determine whether they are spam or legitimate messages. To achieve this, we will utilize essential libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and structuring, along with the Logistic Regression algorithm, a powerful tool for binary classification.
